## Introduction

HagenKit is a batteries-included SaaS boilerplate that combines modern product design with production-ready infrastructure. Built on Next.js 16 and the App Router, it delivers authentication, multi-tenant workspaces, dashboards, and a marketing site so you can focus on customer value instead of scaffolding.

**Highlights**
- **Multi-tenant SaaS foundations** – Workspace model with owner/admin/member/viewer roles, invitations, and default workspace management.
- **Authentication that scales** – Better Auth with email/password, Google OAuth, session management, and client helpers for hydration-safe flows.
- **Responsive UI system** – Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS components, marketing sections, and dashboard primitives tuned for accessibility.
- **Email-ready out of the box** – React Email templates and Resend integration for transactional messages.
- **Developer velocity** – TypeScript everywhere, server actions, data hooks, and deploy-ready configuration for Vercel.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hagenkit.git
cd hagenkit
pnpm install
```

Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Update `.env.local` with your credentials:

- `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL (direct connection).
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- OAuth providers such as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Optional integrations (`RESEND_API_KEY`, Stripe keys, etc.).

Generate the Prisma client and sync the schema:

```bash
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:push
```

Start the development server with Turbopack:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- `pnpm email` – launch the React Email preview server.
- `pnpm lint` – run ESLint with the project config.

## Magic Link Setup

HagenKit supports Magic Link authentication out of the box.

### Development
For a seamless developer experience, if you do not provide a `RESEND_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file while in development mode, **emails will be logged to your terminal console**.

1.  Go to the Sign In page.
2.  Enter your email and click "Sign in with Magic Link".
3.  Check your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running.
4.  Click the link printed in the console to sign in.

### Production
For production, you must set up Resend:

1.  Create an account at [Resend](https://resend.com).
2.  Get your API Key.
3.  Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to your environment variables.
4.  Verify your domain in Resend to ensure emails are delivered reliably.

## 🛡️ Security: First User Setup

**Automatic Admin Assignment:**
HagenKit automatically assigns the `admin` role to the **first user** who signs up. This ensures you have immediate access to the admin panel without any manual database manipulation.

1.  **First Sign-Up**: The first user created in the system will be granted the `admin` role.
2.  **Subsequent Users**: All users signing up after the first one will be assigned the default `user` role.

**No manual schema changes or migrations are required.** The system handles this logic securely via database hooks.

## Tech Stack + Features

### Frameworks & Platforms
- **Next.js 16** – App Router, Server Actions, and edge-ready rendering.
- **Prisma ORM v7 + PostgreSQL** – Type-safe ORM with `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver for direct TCP connections. Generated client in `app/generated/prisma`.
- **Better Auth** – Composable auth with cookie/session helpers and social providers.
- **Vercel** – First-class deployment target with optimized build output.

### UI & UX
- **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS** – Component library with design tokens and Radix primitives.
- **Framer Motion (via `motion`)** – Micro-interactions and animation choreography.
- **Lucide & Tabler Icons** – Consistent iconography across marketing and product surfaces.
- **Responsive marketing shell** – Polished landing page in `app/(marketing)` with reusable layout primitives.

### Application Capabilities
- **Dashboard modules** – Team, analytics, lifecycle, and settings routes ready for data wiring.
- **Workspace management** – Invitations, member role updates, and ownership safeguards.
- **Settings UI** – Account, profile, and workspace panels using configurable data tables (`@tanstack/react-table`).
- **Search & filtering utilities** – `nuqs` for deep-linkable filters and stateful navigation.
- **Productivity hooks** – Debounced callbacks, media queries, and mobile detection helpers.

### Communications
- **React Email** templates in `emails/` ready for transactional flows.
- **Resend** integration glue for real email delivery.

## Architecture

HagenKit separates concerns to keep features composable and scalable:

- **App Router segmentation** – Marketing `app/(marketing)`, auth flows `app/(auth)`, admin area `app/(admin)`, and the authenticated dashboard under `app/dashboard`.
- **Server Actions** – Business logic lives in `app/actions/*` with typed inputs and output helpers (`ActionResult`).
- **Data Layer** – Prisma schema models users, sessions, workspaces, invitations, and roles for robust multi-tenancy.
- **Configuration** – Centralized metadata in `lib/config.ts` powers SEO, social cards, and upgrade CTAs.
- **UI System** – Shared primitives in `components/ui`, marketing layout helpers, and specialized dashboard/admin components.
